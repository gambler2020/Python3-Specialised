I would love to try or hear the sample audio your app can produce. I do not want to purchase, because I've purchased so many apps that say they do something and do not deliver.  

Can you please add audio samples with text you've converted? I'd love to see the end results.

Thanks!
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to present and exchange documents reliably, independent of software, hardware, or operating system. Invented by Adobe.
Because this file format doesn’t rely on the software nor hardware, it is often use to present product graphics, ebooks, flyers, job applications, scanned documents, brochures. It looks the same no matter what device they’re opened on.

 

So if you’re a developer or tester and want to check the functionalities of your app or demo, just download this free pdf file. Remember that pdf files are the one in which you want to preserve the original graphic appearance on any device and software.
